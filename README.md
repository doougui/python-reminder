# Python Reminder
> A simple Python reminder to help you remember your tasks

![](header.png)

## Getting Started

This project uses Python 3.x, so you will need to have this version installed in your device. To install, go to the [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) website and download version 3.

### Prerequisites

You will need to install some Python libraries so that everything works correctly. To do this, open the Terminal inside the folder of your project and type the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running

To run the script on background you can type the following command inside the root folder of the script:

```
python3 /path/to/file/reminder.py &
```

### Run on startup (on Linux)

To run the script on startup (so that you don't have to run it every time you turn your computer on), you can type the same command that I showed you above inside your `/etc/rc.local` file:

```
python3 /path/to/file/reminder.py &
```

**It's done :)**
